## Installation

#### io
Requires [io](https://iolanguage.org/). Day 15 requires the [PriorityQueue](https://github.com/lewis-weinberger/PriorityQueue.git) addon which can be installed with the [eerie](https://github.com/IoLanguage/eerie) package manager:

```sh
eerie install https://github.com/lewis-weinberger/PriorityQueue.git
```

## Usage

Problem inputs are read from STDIN:

```sh
./n < input.txt
```

The solutions to both parts of the problem are then printed:

```
A) ... solution here ...
B) ... solution here ...
```
