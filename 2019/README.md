## Installation

To run the Go solutions you'll need to install [Golang](https://golang.org/). To run the Scheme implementations you'll need a working installation of [GNU Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/download/). To run the Rust implementations you'll need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). To run the Lua implementations you'll need [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) (the `aoc` script uses [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/luajit.html)). See the [aoc](../aoc) script.

## Usage

Problem inputs are read from STDIN:

```sh
./day_n < input.txt
```

The solutions to both parts of the problem are then printed:

```
A) ... solution here ...
B) ... solution here ...
```
