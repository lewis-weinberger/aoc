## Installation

#### Scheme
Requires a Scheme (R6RS) implementation, such as 
[Chez](https://github.com/cisco/chezscheme). 

## Usage

Problem inputs are read from STDIN:

```sh
chezscheme --script n.ss < input.txt # day n
```

The solutions to both parts of the problem are then printed:

```
... solution here ...
... solution here ...
```
